Creating a Grid from 5 x 6 with variable heights, 
a navigation that moves through transition ( through pages),
and where dynamic json data is loaded.


What it currently does:

- Sets a grid of 5 * 6
- Inserts Navigation which allows the user to navigate through the pages (either by clicking the buttons or keyboard)
- depending on the data-content attribute, dynamic content is loaded in ( now 2 options: flickr and reddit )


Possible roadmap
- Filling every page with data based on search in cleaner fashion 
- responsive design
- cleanup & comment code + error handling
- Making use of templating system (handlebars) to avoid all repetition in index.html
- set the code in mvc framework (backbone)


- have a visual, clickable sitemap
- Setup grunt (jslint, minification, movement etc)
- speed optimalization
- browser compability (not important at the moment)
- device compability ( enable swiping, setting buttons larger)
