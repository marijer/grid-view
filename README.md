Creating a Grid from 5 x 6 with variable heights, 
a navigation that moves through transition ( through pages),
and where dynamic json data is loaded.


What it currently does:

I setup the grid of pages, this can be navigated through either mouse or keyboard.
Some flickr data is loaded in on the first page, based on data attribute in the article.




What I could focus on
- Filling every page with random data in a cleaner method 
- responsive design
- cleanup & comment code + error handling
- Making use of templating system (handlebars) to avoid all repetition in index.html
- set the code in mvc framework (backbone)


- have a visual, clickable sitemap
- Setup grunt (jslint, minification, movement etc)
- speed optimalization
- browser compability (not important at the moment)
- device compability ( enable swiping, setting buttons larger)
